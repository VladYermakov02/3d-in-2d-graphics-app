# 3d in 2d Graphics App

## Abstract
Developed a program to display the frame of two given figures and a piece of surface in three-dimensional space.
Figure - Triangular pyramid.
Type of projection - Rectangular dimension.
Surface representation method - Hermite shape.
Provided:
- affine transformations of each figure and surface; 
- the ability for the user to set the parameters of transformations; 
- an image of a figure with a given type of projection (isometry or dimetry); 
- images of projections of figures on the XOY, XOZ, and YOZ planes; 
- Axis images with labels; 
- provided the possibility of hiding invisible lines or marking them with unctuous lines when depicting shapes.
